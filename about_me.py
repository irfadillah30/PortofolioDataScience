             Hello!!!...
             My name is Irfadillah Afni Nurvita.\n 
             I am a graduate with a Bachelorâ€™s Degree in Computer Information Systems from the Indonesian Open University (GPA: 3.34/4.00) who is passionate about technology, data, and continuous learning. I have 2.5 years of experience as a contract employee in the production department of a pharmaceutical manufacturing company, followed by 1 year as a Quality Control helper, and I am currently interning in Japan in the field of electroplating. Throughout my journey, I have actively participated in seminars related to technology, scholarships, and personal development, while also joining several bootcamps to strengthen my skills in data science, graphic design, and other digital fields. In the Data Science Bootcamp at Dibimbing.id (GPA: 92.33/100), I gained practical experience in data processing, machine learning, statistical programming, data visualization, industrial analysis, data modeling, clustering, and feature engineering, as well as strategies for model evaluation and improvement. These experiences have allowed me to combine my background in manufacturing and quality control with strong analytical and creative skills, shaping my interest in data-driven problem solving, industrial efficiency, and innovation.
